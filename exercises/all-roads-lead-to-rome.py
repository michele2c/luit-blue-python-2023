"""
All Roads Lead to Rome

You are given a list with various flight connections in Europe. Each connection is represented as a tuple with the following elements:

(city_from, city_to, time)

For example, the following tuple represents a flight from Amsterdam to Dublin which takes 100 minutes:

('Amsterdam', 'Dublin', 100)

Your task is to go through all the routes in a loop and check how many of them lead to Rome (i.e. how many of them have city_to equal to 'Rome'). Among the routes to Rome, you should also calculate the average flight time. Print the following the output:

{} connections lead to Rome with an average flight time of {} minutes

Replace {} with the number of connections and the average flight time.
