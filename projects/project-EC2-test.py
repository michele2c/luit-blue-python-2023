"""
Project - EC2 Random Name Generator
"""
# **Use Case**

# Several departments share an AWS environment. You need to 
# ensure that the EC2s are properly named and are unique so team members 
# can easily tell who the EC2 instances belong to. Use Python to create 
# your unique EC2 names that the users can then attach to the instances. 

# The Python Script should:

# 1. All the user to input how many EC2 instances they want names for and output the same amount of unique names.

# 2. Allow the user to input the name of their department that is used in the unique name.

# 3. Generate random characters and numbers that will be included in the unique name.

# 4. Push your code to GitHub and include the link in your LinkedIn write up.
